            The subject content for GCSE Computer Science will be assessed across three
            components. In Component 1, content is assessed in a theoretical way, whereas in Component 2 it is
            assessed through its use within programs and algorithms. Component 3 is assessed as your ability to
            analyse a problem, document it and develop a solution in a supported language.

            Computers are widely used in all aspects of business, industry, government,
        education, leisure and the home. In this technological age, a study of computer
        science, and particularly how computers are used in the solution of a variety of
        problems, is essential to learners.<br />
            <br />
            Computer science integrates well with subjects across the curriculum. It demands
        both logical discipline and imaginative creativity in the selection and design of
        algorithms and the writing, testing and debugging of programs; it relies on an
        understanding of the rules of language at a fundamental level; it encourages an
        awareness of the management and organisation of computer systems; it extends
        learners' horizons beyond the school or college environmentn the appreciation of
        the effects of computer science on society and individuals.
